# UFOs

# Overview

 The project is to create a website that allows not only the UFO data to be displayed on a table, but filtered in real-time. A user can filter by date, city, state, country, and type of sighting. 

### Resources
- Javascript and HTML.
- d3 and Bootstrap libraries.

# Results

The website filters user input into the filter search as both individual or combined filters. As shown below, there's placeholder text inside the input boxes. Placeholder text assists the user in knowing which format the input requires.
